//
// A dual-clock FIFO: gray-coded pointers, two-flop synchronisers, and a
// first-word-fall-through read.
//
// It exists for sun2_fifo_bridge, which puts one of these on each side of the
// crossing between the machine's cpu_clk and the memory controller's clock:
// requests out, read data back.  It is written here rather than borrowed from
// Inputs/Wish82586/src/async_fifo.sv -- which it follows closely -- because the
// machine's memory path should not depend on an Ethernet submodule, and
// because rtl/sun2-common is Verilog-2001 and that one is SystemVerilog.
//
// **First word fall through.**  `rd_data' is the head of the queue whenever
// `rempty' is low, with no read strobe needed to see it, and `rd_en' consumes
// it.  The bridge needs that: it looks at the head's tag before deciding
// whether to take it.  The storage is therefore read asynchronously -- LUT RAM
// on a Xilinx part, registers on a MAX 10, which has no asynchronous-read
// memory -- and that is only acceptable because the depths used are tiny.
//
// **Why the asynchronous read is safe across the domains.**  An entry is
// written on a wclk edge and the write pointer that covers it is registered on
// that same edge, then passes two rclk flops before `rempty' can fall.  So the
// storage cell has been stable for at least two read clocks before anything in
// the read domain looks at it.  Nothing reads a cell that is being written:
// the write side only ever writes the one entry the read side cannot yet see.
//
// **Pointers cross as registered gray code**, one bit changing per step, with
// no logic between the source register and the first synchroniser flop, so a
// synchroniser that resolves late sees either the old pointer or the new one
// and never a mixture.  Simulation cannot check any of that -- there is no
// metastability in a simulator -- which is why the structure is written out
// plainly and left for report_cdc to confirm on the netlist.
//
// **Resets.**  `wrst' and `rrst' are synchronous to their own clocks and
// clear their own side.  The FIFO is only consistent if both are held long
// enough to overlap, as the bridge does; releasing one side alone while the
// other holds a non-empty queue desynchronises the pointers.
//
// DEPTH is 2**ADDR, and ADDR must be at least 2: the full comparison inverts
// the top two bits of the synchronised read pointer.
