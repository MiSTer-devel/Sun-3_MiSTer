//
// The 3/60's bw2 frame buffer, on an HDMI screen.  From the Sun-2 project's
// rtl/sun2-common/fb_scanout.sv, which has the history of every choice.
//
// Reads 1152x900x1 out of DDR3 and presents it as 24-bit RGB at whatever
// position the video timing is drawing, centred 1:1 in the board's mode:
// VESA 1280x1024@60 (108 MHz), 64 pixels of border either side and 62 lines
// above and below.
//
// Two clock domains meet here:
//
//   ui_clk     the memory controller's: MIG's ui_clk (83.33 MHz, mig_arb
//              client 1) or BrianHG's CMD_CLK (125 MHz, port 1)
//   clk_pixel  108 MHz, where cx/cy come from and pixels go out
//
// They are joined by a **ping-pong line buffer**, not a stream FIFO: only two
// one-bit toggles cross (start of frame, start of line), and only the block
// RAM is shared.  A line costs ~9 reads (about 2.4 us on MIG) against a
// 15.6 us line, so the fetch has room.
//
// **Bit order.**  A 128-bit beat is 128 consecutive pixels.  The 68020 bus is
// big-endian and the bridges put a 32-bit bus word on Wishbone unchanged
// (byte 0 = bits 31:24), and the DDR3 adapters put word k of a line at
// [k*32 +: 32].  The Architecture Manual (5.3) puts the top-left pixel in bit
// 15 of word 0, i.e. bit 31 of the first long word.  So pixel p of a beat is
// bit {p[6:5], ~p[4:0]} -- unlike the Sun-2, whose 16-bit bridge swapped
// halfwords.
//
// **Polarity.**  1 bits are black, 0 bits are white (Architecture Manual
// 5.3).  The border, and the whole screen while EN.VIDEO is off, are black.
