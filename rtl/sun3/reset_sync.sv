//
// Reset synchroniser: asserts asynchronously, releases synchronously.
//
// The board's reset condition is assembled in the clk50 domain from the
// button, the MMCM lock and MIG's calibration status, none of which are
// related to the clock the logic being reset actually runs on.  Feeding that
// straight into flip-flop clear pins leaves the *release* unsynchronised:
// registers come out of reset at slightly different times depending on routing,
// and the recovery/removal checks fail -- which is what the Sun-2's first
// build reported, on the path into the SCC.
//
// Holding the reset asynchronously is what we want (it works before any clock
// is running); releasing it on a clock edge in the destination domain is what
// makes that safe.
//
// ASYNC_REG keeps the chain in one slice and tells the tools these registers
// are expected to go metastable (spelled through sun3_attr.vh).
//
// This lives in rtl/ rather than under a board because async-assert /
// sync-release is not a property of any board.  From the Sun-2 project.
