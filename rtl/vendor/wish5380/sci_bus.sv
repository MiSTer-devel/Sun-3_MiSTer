// Everything of the NCR 5380 that is not a register: what it drives onto the
// SCSI bus, what it reports back, the arbitration it does on its own, the
// REQ/ACK handshake it automates in DMA mode, and the six things that make it
// interrupt.
//
// The chip is unusually thin.  It has no address counter and no byte counter,
// and above a single handshake it does almost nothing: the driver drives SEL,
// releases BSY, counts the bytes and decides when a phase is over, by writing
// registers one at a time.  Section 7 (p. 18) lists the whole of what is in
// hardware - DMA transfers, arbitration, phase change monitoring, bus
// disconnection, bus reset, parity checking, and selection/reselection - and
// that list is what this module is.
//
// The part is clockless (p. 18): its bus free, bus set and bus settle delays
// come out of gate propagation and "may differ between devices because of
// inherent process variations".  A clocked replica counts them out instead,
// so they are derived from CLK_PERIOD_PS rather than written down, and a
// build for a slower machine moves them together.
//
// The 2.2 us arbitration delay is deliberately absent.  The datasheet is
// explicit that the chip does not implement it - "This delay must be
// implemented in the controlling software driver" (p. 18) - and both
// reference drivers do, Linux as udelay(3) for the SCSI-2 value of 2.4 us.
// Counting it here would make a driver that omitted it work when on real
// silicon it would not.
