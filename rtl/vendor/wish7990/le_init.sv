// The initialisation block reader.
//
// When the host sets CSR0.INIT the chip reads twelve 16-bit words from IADR
// and keeps what it finds: the mode word, our physical address, the logical
// address filter, and where the two descriptor rings are and how long they
// are (datasheet p. 23).  Then it sets IDON, and the driver waits up to 10 ms
// for that before giving up - `CDELAY((le->le_csr & LE_IDON), 10000)` in
// doc/drivers/SunOS414/if_le.c.
//
// **Twelve halfword reads, not six word reads.**  CSR1 forces bit 0 of IADR to
// zero and nothing more, so the block is only 16-bit aligned and a 32-bit read
// could straddle its end.  This happens once per INIT, so fidelity is worth
// more than six saved bus cycles; doc/interface.md records the choice and
// sys_initialise_reads_twelve_words holds it.
//
// This block also owns RXON and TXON, because it owns MODE.  p. 21: RXON "is
// set when STRT is set if DRX = 0 in the MODE register and the initialization
// block has been read by the C-LANCE"; TXON is the same with DTX.  Both are
// cleared by a memory error, and TXON also by an underflow or buffer error
// during transmission - which is why they are levels an engine can pull down.
