// Address recognition: does this frame belong to us?
//
// Its own file because the hash is the one piece of this chip that no header
// writes down.  Everything else here can be checked against a datasheet bit
// number; this has to be checked against a transcription of the loop in
// doc/drivers/SunOS414/if_le.c lines 780-806, and against NetBSD's
// lance_setladrf(), because a hash that agrees only with our own testbench
// would filter perfectly in simulation and wrongly on a real network.
//
// Four ways in, in this order (datasheet pp. 25-26):
//
//   1. MODE.PROM accepts everything.
//   2. Broadcast - all forty-eight bits set - is always accepted and does not
//      go through the filter, so a LADRF of all zeroes still receives it.
//   3. Bit 0 of the first octet clear means a physical address, which must
//      equal PADR exactly.
//   4. Otherwise it is a logical address: all six octets go through the
//      Ethernet CRC-32 and the top six bits of the *running remainder* -
//      before any final complement or reflection - index the 64-bit LADRF.
//
// Note what the hash is not.  It is not the FCS: crc32_eth's fcs_o is the
// inverted residue and would give a different bucket entirely.  crc_o is the
// residue itself, which is what the driver's loop leaves in its variable.
//
// A hash lets through more than the driver asked for, and every LANCE driver
// knows it: p. 25, "The logical address filter only assures that there is a
// possibility that the incoming logical address belongs to the node", and the
// driver searches its own list afterwards.
