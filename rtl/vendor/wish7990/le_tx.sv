// The transmit ring engine.
//
// The chip owns whichever transmit descriptors have OWN set.  It finds them by
// polling: every 1.6 ms while STRT is set, or immediately when the host writes
// CSR0.TDMD.  A poll reads TMD1 and nothing else (datasheet p. 30); only once
// OWN is found set does it read TMD0 and TMD2 for the address and the count.
//
// A descriptor with OWN set but STP clear is *skipped* - p. 29: "The STP bit
// must be set in the first buffer of the packet, or the C-LANCE will skip over
// this descriptor and poll the next descriptor(s) until the OWN and STP bits
// are set."  Skipped, not an error, and nothing is written back.
//
// The whole frame is staged in dp_ram before mii_tx starts, so a collision
// retry costs nothing: mii_tx reads the RAM again and no host memory is touched
// twice.  That is inherited from Wish82586's command unit and is why the retry
// loop over in mii_tx is as simple as it is.
//
// Two orderings come straight from the datasheet and are the easy things to
// get plausibly wrong:
//
//   * **The lookahead precedes the release.**  p. 30-31: while chaining, the
//     chip reads the next descriptor before it relinquishes the current one,
//     "clears the OWN bit for this buffer, and immediately starts loading the
//     Transmit FIFO from the next buffer".  Doing it the other way round would
//     hand a buffer back and only then discover there was nowhere to put the
//     BUFF error describing why the frame died.
//   * **Status lands in the last descriptor, OWN goes out alone and last.**
//     p. 31: "Once the last part of the packet has been transmitted to the
//     medium, the C-LANCE will update the status in TMD1, TMD3 ... and will
//     relinquish the last buffer to the CPU."  And
//     doc/drivers/SunOS414/if_le.c lines 1434-1444 states what the driver
//     relies on: "since the chip uses the order <clear own bit, set RINT>, we
//     must use the opposite order <clear RINT, set own bit>".  So TMD3 first
//     when there is anything to say, then TMD1 as a 16-bit write of its own,
//     then TINT.
