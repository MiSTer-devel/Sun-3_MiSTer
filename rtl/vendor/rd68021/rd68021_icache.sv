//
// The on-chip instruction cache -- UM section 4.
//
// "A direct-mapped cache of 64 long-word entries. Each cache entry consists of a
// tag field (A31-A8 and FC2), one valid bit, and 32 bits (two words) of
// instruction data" (UM 4.1). The index is A7-A2, and A1 picks the word, which is
// the cache holding register's business rather than this module's: a lookup here
// answers with the whole long word.
//
// ENTRIES is a power of two from 2 to 64. Fewer entries means a narrower index and
// a correspondingly wider tag, so the cache is smaller and never wrong. 64 is the
// MC68020; the others are here because an FPGA build may want the area back.
// ENTRIES = 0 -- no cache at all -- is the IFU's decision and never instantiates
// this module.
//
// Reset. The array is a RAM and is NOT reset -- no flop in it, and nothing reads
// it unqualified. The valid bits are 64 ordinary flip-flops with an asynchronous
// reset, and they are the whole of "during processor reset, the cache is cleared
// by resetting all of the valid bits" (UM 4.2). A lookup of an entry whose valid
// bit is clear never looks at the tag or the data, so what the RAM powered up
// holding is unobservable.
//
// The read is asynchronous. 64 x 57 bits is distributed RAM on the FPGAs this
// targets (one LUT per bit on a 7-series part), so the lookup costs no clock and
// the hit is a tag compare on the output: the IFU can decide between the cache
// and the bus in the same clock it learns which long word it wants.
