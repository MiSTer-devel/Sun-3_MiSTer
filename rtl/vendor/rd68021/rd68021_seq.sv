  // retires -- the queue has a word, it is simply a bad one -- so the fault is
  // taken on the retirement and nothing commits. Reading the ADDRESS of stage C
  // is not a use: PC_C and EABASE are right whatever the word is.
  //
  // The second is to WAIT for a word that will never come: stage D is empty and
  // the front of the queue is faulted, so nothing may be loaded into it, or the
  // fetch address is odd and no cycle will be run at all. That one is the
  // address error as well, and the pipe says which.
  //
  // Either way the frame is the long one: the microword that could not have its
  // word is re-executed after RTE, and it may depend on any working register.
