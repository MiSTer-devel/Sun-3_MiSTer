//
// Instruction fetch unit: the cache holding register, the three-stage instruction
// pipe, and the instruction cache.
//
// UM 1.6 and figure 1-5: "instruction words (instruction operation words and all
// extension words) enter the pipe at stage B and proceed to stages C and D. An
// instruction word is completely decoded when it reaches stage D of the pipe."
// So stage D is the instruction register -- it holds the opcode for the whole
// instruction -- and extension words are read from stage C.
//
// The pipe is therefore stage D, plus a two-deep queue holding C and B:
//
//   CONSUME   pop: C <- B, B <- the next word. D is untouched; an extension word
//             has been eaten.
//   ADV       D <- C, then pop. The instruction is over.
//   FLUSH     everything is emptied and refilled from the address on `pf_addr`.
//
// pc_d is the address of stage D and stg_b_addr the address of stage B, both
// carried as real registers because CONSUME moves one and not the other. UM 6.2
// makes that observable: at an instruction boundary the pipe is sequential and
// the short fault frame derives the stage addresses from the PC, but
// mid-instruction it is not, which is exactly why the long frame carries stage
// B's address at SP+$24.
//
// The queue refills by itself. UM 5.5.1 is what makes that safe: "if a bus error
// occurs on an instruction fetch, the processor does not take the exception until
// it attempts to use that instruction word" -- so a faulted prefetch is recorded
// in the stage's fault bit and becomes an exception only when the sequencer
// reaches it, which is what SSW's FB and FC bits are for.
//
// This is a module rather than part of the sequencer because the architecture
// names its state: SSW FC/FB/RC/RB and frame fields +$0C, +$0E and +$24 make
// stages B and C visible through the fault frame, and every such register has to
// be nameable and restorable. See doc/checkpoint.md.
